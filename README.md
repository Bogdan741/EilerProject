# EilerProject
Solutions to some tasks from EilerProject.

Most python code I wrote when I was in 9-10 grade at school, so it may look pretty awful. Some c++ solutions I've written recently so it looks better.

The name of the most file are self-explanatory and correspond to the number of the task in EilerProject. 

Not all solutions are optimised but even so some ideas are quite good.

Hope you'll find it useful.
